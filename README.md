# Network analysis of Wikipedia Norms

Analysis of a network composed by Wikipedia Norm (see the original paper for more information). There are two parts:

* Metrics and model: main statistics and create new graphs synthetically based on different network models. Mention there is also a part of detection and visualization of possible communities using Gephi, a work which continues in next part.

* Communities and spreading process: analyze and obtain the possible communities in the network, this time with R function, and simulation of a spreading process.

All the required data is stored in the folder **dataset**.
